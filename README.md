## Features

- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to the cart, which stores items and quantities.
- **Modify Cart Items**: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of products in the cart, or remove them entirely.
- **Responsive Design**: The product page is fully responsive and works seamlessly across devices of various screen sizes.
- **Slider**: A product image slider to showcase multiple views of the product.
- **State Management**: All cart and product-related state is managed with React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
- **LocalStorage**: The cart is persisted using `localStorage`, so users can refresh the page without losing their items.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## Future Improvements

- There are some minor fixes I will be working on before my submission deadline. Those are as follows.
- I have skipped one or two layout. Those are east and negligible ones.
- The slider works when swiping (in mobile) or right and left arrow keys. The navigator buttons still don't work. 
- The text size for responsive screensizes could have been maintained centrally. 
- The spaces are not properly maintained in the responsive design.
